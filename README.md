Blog project 

A blogging web page project for Accenture bootcamp. 

Unsolved issues so far:
-havent got ability to modify(update) and delete posts, comments, user profile (but have ready functions on the back end for some of them);
-can not create blog post longer than 1024 characters (can not store it in the database);
-havent got author(user) for comments and posts;
-have to reload page to see newly added comment;
-categories link works only once from the "Read" page (have to reload link);
-haven't implemented error notifications appearing in the UI. To see request errors (login, register, post, comment, etc.. ), have to look in the console or Network->Response.

Have saved back end to the 'master' and UI to the 'front-end' branch.
